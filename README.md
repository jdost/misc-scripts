# Scripts

A collection of the various scripts I have written to help make my experience on a
system easier.  (Hopefully) each folder will include a README describing the script
and documenting any requirements and setup (the standard will improve as I figure
it out).

## Included

[Wallpaper](wallpaper/README.md) - Scripts that I use on a cronjob to change 
randomly from a folder I keep of various wallpapers
[Bluetooth](bluetooth/README.md) - Scripts I have to turn on and pair with devices
that I own, useful for tying to keys in a WM
[Macbook Air](mba/README.md) - Scripts I have written to help control hardware 
options on my Macbook Air, aimed at use with my WM
[Customization](customization/README.md) - Scripts I have that are useful for 
displaying information or showing off a setup for the customization community
