# AUR

This is a script that helps manage AUR packages.  These are for Arch Linux and are
a way to install applications that are not part of the main repository.  They are
just standardized scripts to build applications from source.  I wrote this script
set to quickly and easily install applications from the repository and update them
with simple commands.

## SETTINGS

Define `$AUR_HOME` to override the default `~/.local/aur/` install folder
